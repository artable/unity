# Overview

The first bit of software in here is a control mechanism mimicking that of one of my favorite games, EV nova. It's sorta rough around the edges right now, but I'd hope to modernize it and modularize it such that most of the control values are products of player choices on the build of their space ship. The second bit makes a bunch of bouncy balls which bounce around and pool in a container in 3D. Just a bit of fun.

# Future Work
The list of things I need to do to make this a real game is far too long to sensibly include, but here are some highlights:
* Create components and relationships such that the aggregate values (acceleration, top speed etc) of a ship are a product of the type and location of a mounted component on the sprite. Like, stick a booster here, you get better rotation.
* make paralaxed randomly generated space tiling for the background.
